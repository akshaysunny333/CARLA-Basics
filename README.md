# CARLA Python API – Basics

This repository contains simple Python scripts using the **CARLA Simulator Python API**.  
The scripts focus on **vehicle spawning and basic sensor usage**, which are fundamental concepts for autonomous driving simulation.

## Files

- `car_spawn.py` – Spawns a vehicle in the CARLA world
- `RGB_camera.py` – Attaches an RGB camera to a vehicle
- `surround_camera.py` – Creates a basic surround-view camera setup
- `LiDAR+RGB.py` – Uses LiDAR and RGB camera sensors together
- `gnss+imu.py` - Displays the value from the GNSS and IMU sensor

## Requirements

- CARLA Simulator (0.9.x)
- Python 3
- CARLA Python API
